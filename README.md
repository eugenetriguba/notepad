> A simple text editor

Notepad is a barebones text editor written in C.

## Building

For most common actions, a `Makefile` is used. To build the
project, you can just `make build` and then `./notepad` to
run the program.

## Testing

Tests are written using [Check](https://libcheck.github.io).

You'll want to install Check on your system to run the tests:
